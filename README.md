This was my first semester project.<br><br>

***NOTE***<br>
-- Run this proect in TURBOC++.<br><br>

***WARNING***<br>
-- There's issue in comparing the date. Reason: Since this was ma first ever college project, I assumed the date format and tha date comparision caused an issue.<br><br>

-- The destination I used are fixed as: <br><br>
1. DAMAK<br>
2. ITAHARI<br>
3. HAIBUNG<br>
4. MELAMCHI<br>
5. TIBENI<br><br>

I will be fixing those issues in the future, and I will update this repo. <br><br> TILL THEN JUST USE THIS PROJECT FOR CONCEPT.
